# Nexus Orchestrator Project: Master Booklet Update (2025-06-19)

This document provides a comprehensive update to the Nexus Orchestrator Project's Master Booklet (original `source.pdf`), detailing the evolved project structure and the integration of new, advanced functionalities.

## 1. Project Overview & Current State

The Nexus Orchestrator Project continues its mission to create a self-optimizing, highly resilient, and dynamically scalable Multi-Agent AI Orchestration System. Following recent consolidation efforts, the project structure is now flattened for improved clarity and direct access to all components from the root directory (`/home/patrick/nexus_orchestrator_project/`).

This update reflects:
* A unified, top-level project directory.
* The integration of asynchronous WebSocket communication for frontend-to-orchestrator API interactions.
* The scaffolding of advanced agentic capabilities, mirroring functionalities found in leading agent development frameworks (without direct library adoption). These include:
    * Integrated Developer Tooling (CLI & Dev UI).
    * Built-in Agent Evaluation (logic components).
    * Broad LLM Support through an abstraction layer.
    * Formalized Artifact Management.
    * Enhanced Session and Memory Management.
